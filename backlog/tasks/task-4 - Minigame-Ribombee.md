## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Create a minigame as dexOS app. A game goes over 5 rounds. The rounds are listed in the left device pane, the actual game screen is on the right pane. The game is about an illustration of a Pokemon being shown and the player has to select one of three graphemes (letters or letter combinations) with which the Pokemon's name starts. e.g. Illustration of Glumanda is shown and the player has to select one of B, G or Ch. We will define a list of German base graphemes the game will work with, that will exclude then some Pokemon names with in German uncommon starting graphemes like Psiana (Ps). The game will read the list of all available Pokemon from the OS, filter out the ones that are not suitable for the game and then pick 5 for the 5 rounds.
